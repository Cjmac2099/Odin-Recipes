    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Cut up chicken pieces and let marinate in BBQ sauce
            for about 2 hours. Let marinate longer if desired. </li>
        <li> When ready, preheat your oven. If you're using a pizza stone, then
            let this preheat for at least 30 minutes. </li>
        <li> While waiting for oven to heat, cook chicken in saute pan with 
            some olive oil until it becomes nice and browned.</li>
        <li> Roll or stretch the dough until it becomes a nice circle</li>
        <li> Spread the remaining BBQ sauce on the crust until completely covered
            and smooth out any wrinkles. Make sure to leave space for the crust. </li>
        <li> Add cheese to crust as desired</li>
        <li> Add the chicken on top before adding desired toppings. Once added, add more cheese on top
            of the two. </li>
        <li> Bake the pizza until cheese is melted and crust is a nice 
            browned color.</li>
        <li> Once finished, remove pizza from oven and add any other desired 
            toppings. Let sit until cook. Once finished, feel free to dig in.
